# Battleship of '25

install: `npm install`\
run: `npm run dev`\
lint: `npm run lint`\
test: `npm run test`

Simple battleship game written in Typescript using React19, React Context, Vitest, and TailwindCSS.

You can display the ships by checking the box in the status block, and you can restart the game any time by clicking on the restart button.

### The assignment:

> The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships.

> Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

> The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

> - 1x Battleship (5 squares)
> - 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

> The player enters coordinates of the form “A5”, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

> You can write a console application or UI to complete the task. Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it simple.
